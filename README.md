# CustomKeys-Bricks
Custom Keys Bricks, its a Custom Keys V2. Based on JS, React-Vite, SCSS, Rust and Tauri. The build allows to create an application, nearly for every OS,
while using simplicity of JS, React and SCSS combo for UI, while Rust and Tauri hold the connectivity and systems logic. Planned that the main app, as host will
hold all the connectivity and all what user may need is just to drop the script file in to modules folder.

The new version ll be much more faster and over all "built properly", with seperate threats per module(script), by built over Rust which is a compile language and
with much more user friendly UI, that ll allow manual scripts switching along with Key Binding functionality. The last addon planned, is to add a **GO-GAME** function,
making transparent overlay for games which may display switches above the game window.

Project under work.
